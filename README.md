*  <h3> Analog Reading from Steering Wheel </h3> Variable Resistor is mapped to the physical motion of the steering wheel. In order to have realistic motion for the wheel 1:3 ratio of gear wheels are used in between the Steering Wheel and tha variable resistor allowing the user to turn the steering wheel full circle for one direction

*  <h3> Analog Reading from Pedals</h3> Variable Resistor is mapped to the physical motion of three pedals.  In order to have realistic motion springs are used with different spring constants according to the pedal. 

*  <h3> Gear Box</h3> Sensitive push buttons are used to detect the current gear in the gearbox. In order to
